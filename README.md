## Build layer for AWS/Lambda

In this case for example, we are building a layer using Python 3.10

```bash
docker run -v "$PWD":/var/task "public.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.10" /bin/sh -c "pip install -r requirements.txt -t python/; exit"
```

Use the ECR gallery to find the image you are looking for: https://gallery.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.10.

In alternative, use the Docker file included here if you are trying to create it using MacOS

```bash
docker build --tag 'ai_agent_aws_lambda_layer' .
# finally to copy the file locally
docker run -v ./lambda-layer-build:/usr/app/local --rm -it ai_agent_aws_lambda_layer sh -c "cp /usr/app/ai_agents_lambda_layer.zip /usr/app/local"
```
